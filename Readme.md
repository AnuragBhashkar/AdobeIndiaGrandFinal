## Special Features ‚ú®

This project comes with a set of powerful features designed to enhance the user's reading and research experience:

* **Personalized Document Storage**: We've implemented user authentication, which means all your uploaded PDFs and the data generated from them are stored securely and are tied to your personal account. üîê
* **High-Speed Caching with Redis**: To ensure a fast and responsive experience, we use Redis for caching and session management. This is a crucial feature that significantly boosts performance. üöÄ
* **Multilingual Insights**: You can translate the generated insights into different languages, making the content more accessible.
* **Bilingual Podcast Generation**: Listen to a summary or key points of your documents on the go! We offer a podcast feature that can generate audio in both **Hindi and English**. üéß
* **Instant Section Navigation**: Jump directly to the relevant section of the PDF from an extracted insight with a **single click**. This allows you to navigate to the exact source of information within the document in the blink of an eye. ‚ö°Ô∏è

## How to Run This Project

### With Docker (Recommended)

Here are two approaches to build and run this project using Docker.

### Approach 1 (Based on the official document)

This approach uses the instructions provided in the `Adobe_Finale Document.pdf`.

##### 1. Build the Docker Image

First, build the Docker image using the following command. This command will build the solution with the platform specified as `linux/amd64` and tag it with your chosen image identifier.

#### docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t yourimageidentifier .
2. Run the Docker Container
Next, run the Docker container with the following command. This will start the application and make it accessible on http://localhost:8080.

This command sets up the necessary environment variables for the application to connect to various services like Adobe PDF Embed API, Google's Gemini LLM, and Azure's Text-to-Speech service. It also mounts a volume for credentials.

Bash

#### docker run -v /path/to/credentials:/credentials \
#### -e ADOBE_EMBED_API_KEY=<ADOBE_EMBED_API_KEY> \
#### -e LLM_PROVIDER=gemini \
#### -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/credentials/adbe-gcp.json \
#### -e GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash \
#### -e TTS_PROVIDER=azure \
#### -e AZURE_TTS_KEY=<TTS_KEY> \
#### -e AZURE_TTS_ENDPOINT=<TTS_ENDPOINT> \
#### -p 8080:8080 yourimageidentifier

Of course. I've updated the docker run command in your readme.md file to use placeholders for the secret keys, making it safe to commit to version control.

Here is the updated section for your readme.md:

### Approach 2 USE google_api_key (Alternative Docker Run Command)
If the first approach does not work, you can use this simplified Docker run command. This command embeds the necessary API keys and endpoints directly as environment variables.

docker run \
  -e ADOBE_EMBED_API_KEY="your_adobe_key_here" \
  -e LLM_PROVIDER="gemini" \
  -e GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here" \
  -e GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-1.5-flash" \
  -e TTS_PROVIDER="azure" \
  -e AZURE_TTS_KEY="your_azure_tts_key_here" \
  -e AZURE_TTS_ENDPOINT="your_azure_tts_endpoint_here" \
  -p 8080:8080 \

Without Docker
If you prefer to run the project without Docker, you can follow these steps to set up the frontend and backend separately.

Backend Setup
Navigate to the Backend Directory:

Bash

cd Backend
Install Dependencies:
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Environment Variables:
You need to set the same environment variables as in the Docker command. You can do this by exporting them in your terminal session or by using a .env file and a library like python-dotenv.

Bash

export ADOBE_EMBED_API_KEY=your_adobe_api_key
export LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
export GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
export TTS_PROVIDER=azure
export AZURE_TTS_KEY=your_azure_tts_key
export AZURE_TTS_ENDPOINT=your_azure_tts_endpoint
Run the Backend Server:

Bash

python main.py
The backend will now be running, typically on a port like 8000.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the Frontend Directory:

Bash

cd Frontend
Install Dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Start the Frontend Development Server:

Bash

npm start
This will start the frontend application, and it should automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000. The frontend will connect to the backend service running on its specified port.
